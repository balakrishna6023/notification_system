        In many educational institutions, effectively communicating fee-related information is a persistent challenge. 
        Fragmented communication often leaves students unaware of upcoming deadlines, resulting in confusion and potential 
        financial mismanagement.
      </p>
      <section className={styles['about-section']}>
        <p className={styles['about-paragraph']}>
          Missed due dates are common when students donâ€™t receive timely reminders or lose track of their responsibilities, 
          leading to late fees or penalties.
        </p>
        <p className={styles['about-paragraph']}>
          Additionally, limited access to payment history complicates financial tracking, making it difficult for students 
          to monitor pending amounts, verify completed payments, and maintain a clear overview of their financial obligations.
        </p>
        <p className={styles['about-paragraph']}>
          To streamline fee communication and address these pain points, we propose a Fee Management Notification System built 
          with React frameworks. This system automates fee reminders and centralizes access to payment records, reducing missed 
          payments and strengthening financial compliance.
